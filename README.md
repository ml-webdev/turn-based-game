# turn-based-game
A turn based game made with vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML
This game was based off of the popular Pokemon franchise. More specifically, I wanted to recreate the battle functionality of the Pokemon Gameboy Advanced games.
Some difficulties I encountered with this project include issues with the battle attack calculation, implementing turn features, and some stylistic issues. 
The app is simple. It is divided into two 
three-section halves: healthbar, sprite, and movelist. You are prompted to select one of the three pokemon, and the second player is prompted the same. The three-section
halves are autopopulated with information pertinent to the selected pokemon. Use the movelist to select a move and inflict damage. The first pokemon to 0 health loses.
I look forward to implementing the strategies I learned in this project into my future work!
